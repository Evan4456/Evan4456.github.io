                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>My fifth work term was a continuation of my time at the Chicken Farmers of Ontario (CFO) as an IT Intern. During this second work term I brought the development work that I completed in my first term through testing, bug fixing and deployment and I have now officially completed an entire professional development project on my own. While doing this I learned a ton and managed to achieve all of my goals on the way. </p>

                    <p>Chicken Farmers of Ontario is a non-profit organization that is responsible for the supply management system that the chicken industry in Ontario relies upon. CFO is strictly responsible for farmers that the production of chicken meat and does not deal with the production of chicken eggs. They exist to preserve the production of chicken here in Ontario and to ensure that production matches demand and that costs remain stable for farmers and consumers. They do this by controlling the amount of chicken produced in Ontario, the amount imported into Ontario and also by ensuring that farmers make fair returns. They were founded in 1965 amidst extreme financial instability among chicken farmers in Ontario where production volume had risen dramatically and live cost had dropped in turn. In order to preserve the industry, CFO was founded to regulate the amount of chicken being produced. They still do this today and their methods for determining accurate demand estimates and fair live prices have expanded to using technology to collect information from farmers all over the province. </p>

                    <h2>Job Description</h2>
                    <p>My role this semester was a continuation of my work in the winter. Where I took the tool that I created in the winter for assessing the construction costs of new barns and took it through the testing and deployment process. This tool was made using SAP ABAP and JavaScript SAPUI5. This summer I deployed my tool across a QA environment created test plans for stakeholders so that we could adequately cover all of the uses of the tool. The Stakeholders tested my tool extensively and I created multiple iterations in order to fix all bugs that were found. Once the tool was in a stable state, I then deployed my tool to the production version of the CFOConnects. I also completed extensive technical documentation for the Barn Cost Survey project so that it can be maintained into the future. After completing all of this my role transitioned into completing more minor bug fixes and tickets that occurred on CFOConnects for the remainder of the summer. </p>
                </div>
                <div id="goals">
                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>I had 3 goals for this semester. The first was to be able to parse requirements from stakeholders on projects. The way I planned to achieve this goal was by parsing and fulfilling Hasan’s evolving requirements for BCS as we finished development and even into testing. I think I achieved this goal as I was able to produce a final product for Hasan that fulfilled all of his requirements and that hundreds of farmers have used already without issue. I did lots of translating as the stakeholder on the project did not seem to have a clear idea of what he wanted the end product to look like so he would come to me with vague ideas and I would translate them into concrete features usually with a couple iterations until the stakeholder had remembered all the requirements that a feature needed to fulfil. This was very valuable, and I have used the skill of translating options and possibilities to stakeholders on other projects since while completing smaller tasks for other teams since then. I do not think it is easy to convey what technology is capable of to non-technical people so I am glad that I completed this goal as communication will be much easier in the future.</p>
                    <p>The second was to be able to investigate and resolve the source of bugs in my own and other code. This goal I intended to achieve by resolving all of the bugs in the testing and QA stage of the BCS project’s life cycle. This success was going to be measured by the launch state of BCS. This I achieved as BCS did launch in a stable state. This involved lots of bug fixing from vague descriptions of issues given to me by stakeholders and even some quick fixes found at the last minute. The investigation involved with this is one of my favorite puzzles to solve as a software developer, even if bugs can sometimes be ridiculous and frustrating. This investigative element I carried through to smaller projects after BCS as well as I completed smaller tickets later in the summer on parts of the application that I had never looked at before. I am happy to have achieved this skill and look forward to using it in the future. </p>
                    <p>My Third goal was to be able to complete technical documentation in a way that was up to professional standards and allowed other developers to maintain my work into the future. My plan to complete this goal was to create a technical specification document for the barn cost survey project and I was going to measure my success on the usefulness of this documentation for developers in the future. My measure for success for this goal is a little bit ridiculous as no one else will need to resolve issues with BCS until after I have gone and the survey will be complete before I even leave. However, I did complete extensive technical documentation for BCS which covered the entirety of the application from front end to back end to database etc., which is not something I have ever done before. So, although I cannot be sure of its quality or usability, it is none the less a skill I developed beyond where I started. I have also completed smaller bits of documentation for bug fixes and other smaller projects I’ve worked on during my time at CFO. I have used those pieces of documentation to remind myself of the situation when returning to projects that have been sitting on the shelf for a while so I know that I can at least write documentation that is helpful to myself. Documentation for people that are not in my own brain remains untested however, and I would like to work on that in the future.</p>

                <div id="conclusion">
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>In Conclusion I think I achieved all of my goals, and I am very proud to have completed an entire product lifecycle in a real world context. From starting the development in the winter, to testing, QA and then deployment. I am very lucky that my boss trusted me enough to allow me to take charge of every aspect of this project and allowed me to essentially complete an entire professional project all on my own. Although I would have liked a bit of feedback on my technical documentation at the end, I am very proud of what I achieved at CFO and I am very grateful for my time there. </p>
