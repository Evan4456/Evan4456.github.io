        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Information About the Employer</h4>
        <p>Agnico Eagle is Canadian gold mining company founded in 1957 that has several precious metal mines around the world in countries such as Canada, Australia, Finland and Mexico. The company also has development projects in the United States and Columbia. In addition to gold, the company also produces a large amount of silver, zinc, and copper as by-products of the mining process. </p>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Job Description</h4>
        <p>     My Role at Agnico during this work term revolved around one main project. This project was the development of an intranet page for the Business Improvement team. This was to be done using Microsoft’s suite of development tools such as SharePoint, Power Automate and PowerApps. </p>
        <p>With these tools I created a page that served various purposes for my team. The main one was to create an interactive dictionary of the company’s stat accounts used to build out an Activity based Costing dashboard that the financial teams at each mine site use to monitor and plan the costs of mine operation. </p>
        <p>I also created tools to define all of the company’s acronyms.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
