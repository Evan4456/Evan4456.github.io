            <p>Agnico Eagle is Canadian gold mining company founded in 1957 that has several precious metal mines around
                the
                world in countries such as Canada, Australia, Finland and Mexico. The company also has development
                projects
                in the United States and Columbia. In addition to gold, the company also produces a large amount of
                silver,
                zinc, and copper as by-products of the mining process. </p>
            <h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>
            <p>For this work term I had four goals: three technical and one general. The three technical ones were to
                develop my python scripting skills, improve my proficiency with SQL and to learn the necessary
                technologies that I would need to create my intranet page. The final, non tech related, skill was to
                enhance my ability to communicate my ideas, document my work and teach others how to use my technology.
                To begin with my non-technical learning goal, improving my oral communication. The way in which I did
                this was by running training sessions to teach my peers how to use some of the technology that I worked
                on. This was a goal for me since I have never done an instructional presentation before, let alone on
                technology. There were also certain challenges I found in addition to the novelty of the task like how
                to cater to people with different technological skill levels as well as people who do not primarily
                speak English. Due to the varying skill levels of the people in my audience, from people in technical
                roles who are very tech savvy to mine administration personnel who have far less technical experience,
                learning how to speak in a way that is clear for everyone, even if I know I am dumbing it down more than
                some people need was quite difficult. I found myself feeling so worried about sounding condescending to
                those that did know what they were talking about, that I may not have gone enough in depth for those who
                did not. Additionally, the fact that my audience was Finnish lead to me producing strong visual aids
                along with my oral presentation so that the strange technical names for buttons that my audience my not
                have known would be able to translate over to Finnish more intuitively. Overall, I think I did make good
                progress on completing this although there were some unanticipated challenges as I mentioned, and I
                believe my next step is to work on presenting in a way that is accessible to all skill levels.
                The first technical goal to discuss is to improve my python scripting abilities. The way I worked on
                this goal was quite simple, I wrote some python. Examples of this are the checking system I created to
                ensure that all desired accounts from the data set that I am visualizing were present as well as an
                automated process for drawing the relational hierarchy of the stats. This taught me new things like
                python graphing libraries like treelib and plotly. Additionally, it gave me the opportunity to learn
                about different ways to collect and display information in python by collecting data from CSVs and PDFs
                and learning about things like pandas. This is a goal that I feel quite successful in as a result. I had
                experience with python already through courses like CIS 2750 and this allowed me to expand my skillset
                beyond making a get/post request handler to now also being able to parse and display information.
                The next technical goal I had was to improve my SQL skills. This is something that was also touched on
                in CIS 2750 but that was with a very small data set. Working at Agnico gave me experience with
                professional and heavily populated data sets and thus allowed me to expand my SQL querying skills in
                this new context. I worked with SQL in order to extract specific information on stat accounts to
                However outside of my learning goals I learned some things that I did not expect. The first of these was
                the ability to document my work and how to do so in a way slightly different to how I did it at school.
                In classes when writing code, documentation looked like comments in my code and a readme to explain to
                Tas how to run my code but in both of these situations I could assume that the person reading it would
                have a certain amount of technical knowledge and thus the documentation only needed to cover the
                specific things that I had thought of and could lean on the fact that the TA already knows how to write
                C or how to use the technologies that I am using, documentation only needed to cover the specifics of my
                project. However, at Agnico this was not an assumption I could lean on as many of the people I was
                working with, specifically the users and maintainers of my Intranet site have very little technical
                knowledge and are not familiar at all with how technologies like SharePoint and PowerApps work. In this
                situation I had to make a very different kind of documentation that felt more like a userâ€™s manual than
                what I was used to writing for classes. Despite the practice I have received doing this already, this is
                not a skill I think I have fully developed as I feel I still sometimes lose my boss when explaining
                things to her so this is something I will be working on further in the fall.
                The other thing that I learned outside of my learning goals was how to design solutions and complete
                tasks with updates in mind. At school I would write the code for a project, hand it in, and then it
                would be complete with no need to revisit or refactor any of it later. However, at Agnico this is very
                rarely the case. Requirements for my work changed constantly as things outside of my control are
                frequently updated and improved. This meant that I needed to learn how to develop solutions that would
                be flexible and easily changed in the future. At the beginning of the work term this was an issue as I
                would end up creating things and then the next week, I would be forced to do a ton more work to
                accommodate changes. An example of this would be when I created a series of PowerApps to display some
                information relating to the companyâ€™s financial accounts, but after I did this, the way that this data
                needed to be displayed changes and instead of simply being able to change the fields being shown I had
                to redo a lot of work to accommodate this new change. This led to me repeating a lot of work due to the
                rigidity of my work. However, across the work term I learned how to create better solutions so that when
                it came to making a way to display information related to the companyâ€™s many acronyms, I was able to
                create a solution that was adaptable, and I can change in mere minutes as requirements change. This is
                an extremely valuable skill, and I am very glad I had this experience to learn it.

            <h4 id="jobDescription">Job Description</h4>
            <p> My Role at Agnico during this work term revolved around one main project. This project was the
                development
                of an intranet page for the Business Improvement team. This was to be done using Microsoftâ€™s suite of
                development tools such as SharePoint, Power Automate and PowerApps. </p>
            <p>With these tools I created a page that served various purposes for my team. The main one was to create an
                interactive dictionary of the companyâ€™s stat accounts used to build out an Activity based Costing
                dashboard
                that the financial teams at each mine site use to monitor and plan the costs of mine operation.
                I also created tools to define all of the companyâ€™s acronyms.With these tools I created a page that
                served
                various purposes for my team. The main one was to create an interactive dictionary of the companyâ€™s stat
                accounts used to build out an Activity based Costing dashboard that the financial teams at each mine
                site
                use to monitor and plan the costs of my operation. I also created tools to define all the companyâ€™s
                acronyms. This included an interactive display with all acronyms including a search bar and tools that
                allows user to add new acronyms and edit the definitions of the existing ones if an error is found.
                Furthermore, I produced a page for the Maintenance team to display all of their Key Performance
                Indicators
                and time classification information. To populate information for the many tools present on these sites I
                used things such as SQL to query databases.</p>
