                    <p>Evan Long</p>
                    <p>Data Analyst</p>
                    <p>Summer 2023</p>

                <div id="abstract">
                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the summer of 2023 I worked at Agnico Eagle as a Data Analyst. In this role I was responsible for the creation of my team’s intranet page. This taught me many new skills like how to use PowerApps, Power Automate and SharePoint and allowed me to refine some skills that I had picked up at school like python and SQL. I also learned some things I didn’t expect like, how to document projects for end users as well as how-to design solutions for easy updating and maintenance. I learned things outside of technical skill as well, like how-to do presentations for people of all technical skill levels. My summer term at Agnico has been extremely valuable to my learning and I cannot wait to continue doing so into the fall. </p>

                    <p>Agnico Eagle is Canadian gold mining company founded in 1957 that has several precious metal mines around the world in countries such as Canada, Australia, Finland, Mexico and development projects in the United States and Columbia. In addition to gold, the company also produces a large amount of silver, zinc, and copper as by-products of the mining process.  </p>

                <div id="jobDescription">
                    <h2>Job Description</h2>
                    <p>My Role at Agnico during this work term revolved around one main project. This project was the development of an intranet page for the Business Improvement team. This was to be done using Microsoft’s suite of development tools such as SharePoint, Power Automate and PowerApps. With these tools I created a page that served various purposes for my team. The main one was to create an interactive dictionary of the company’s stat accounts used to build out an activity-based costing dashboard that the financial teams at each mine site use to monitor and plan the costs of operation. I also created tools to define all the company’s acronyms. This included an interactive display with all the acronyms, a search bar and tools that allow the user to add new and edit existing acronyms. Furthermore, I produced a page for the Maintenance team to display all their Key Performance Indicators and time classification information.  To populate information for the many tools present on these sites I used things such as SQL to query databases. </p>
                </div>
                <div id="goals">
                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>For this work term I had four goals: three technical and one general. The three technical ones were to develop my python scripting skills, improve my proficiency with SQL and to learn the necessary technologies that I would need to create my intranet page. The final, non tech related, skill was to enhance my ability to communicate my ideas, document my work and teach others how to use my technology.</p>
                    <h4>Oral Communication</h4>
                    <p>To begin with my non-technical learning goal, improving my oral communication. The way in which I did this was by running training sessions to teach my peers how to use some of the technology that I worked on. This was a goal for me since I have never done an instructional presentation before, let alone on technology. There were also certain challenges I found in addition to the novelty of the task like how to cater to people with different technological skill levels as well as people whose first language is not English. Due to the varying skill levels of the people in my audience, from people in technical roles who are very tech savvy to mine administration personnel who have far less technical experience, learning how to speak in a way that is clear for everyone, even if I know I am dumbing it down more than some people need was quite difficult. I found myself feeling so worried about sounding condescending to those that did know what they were talking about, that I may not have gone enough in depth for those who did not. Additionally, the fact that my audience was Finnish lead to me producing strong visual aids along with my oral presentation so that the strange technical names for buttons that my audience may not have known, would be able to translate over to Finnish more intuitively. Overall, I think I did make good progress on completing this although there were some unanticipated challenges as I mentioned, and I believe my next step is to work on presenting in a way that is accessible to all skill levels. </p>
                    <h4>Python Skills</h4>
                    <p>The first technical goal to discuss was my goal to improve my python scripting abilities. The way I worked on this goal was quite simple, I wrote python scripts. Examples of this are the checking system I created to ensure that all desired accounts from the data set that I am visualizing were present as well as an automated process for drawing the relational hierarchy of the stats. This taught me python graphing libraries like treelib and plotly. Additionally, it gave me the opportunity to learn about different ways to collect and display information in python by collecting data from CSVs and PDFs and learning about things like pandas. This is a goal that I feel quite successful in as a result. I had experience with python already through courses like CIS 2750 and this allowed me to expand my skillset beyond making a get/post request handler to now also being able to parse and display information. Data collection and visualization is a large use case for python and will definitely be useful in other data related roles going forward. </p>
                    <h4>SQL Skills</h4>
                    <p>The next technical goal I had was to improve my SQL skills. This is something that was also touched on in CIS 2750 but with a very small data set. Working at Agnico gave me experience with professional and heavily populated data sets and thus allowed me to expand my SQL querying skills in this new context. I worked with SQL to extract specific information on stat accounts to build various visuals for the intranet page like interactive dictionaries, as well as PowerBI dashboards/visualisations.  The challenge to my SQL skills expanded further than just the size but also was difficult because the data set is constantly updated and needed to remain as a live link. This posed a challenge because all the work that I did needed to be specific enough to include only the information I wanted but also general enough to accommodate all future additions to the data set. One example of this that comes to mind is when I was grouping stat accounts into categories that would need to accommodate all future additions to the category. So, instead of writing SQL queries to grab specific accounts, I came up with a more adaptable query that grouped accounts by their spot in the hierarchy of accounts. After this and serval other SQL related projects, I feel that this is one of the skills I developed most comprehensively in this role as all elements of my site that rely on SQL to update do so very smoothly. </p>
                    <h4>PowerApps, Power Automate & SharePoint</h4>
                    <p>My final learning goal was the one that I spent the most time on throughout the work term, developing skills with PowerApps, Power Automate and SharePoint. I became very familiar with SharePoint throughout the work term in the creation of my team's intranet site. Through this I learned all about SharePoint like how to create pages, navbars, site elements, site permissions and how the list system works. I used all these different aspects of SharePoint extensively and now feel comfortable completing and implementing nearly any new features or changes that my manager/peers request. Additionally, I used power automate to create several flows that automate different aspects of my intranet page, such as data collection, validation and approval processes. I have used PowerApps as well quite a bit to embed more complicated functions into my intranet page like interactive dictionaries and search functions. All of these have combined to create a very well received site that demonstrates my completion of this goal. The main difficulty I found with completing this skill was the lack of formal training and having to learn it all on my own on the fly. But I think that was a very rewarding experience because being able to learn on my own is a skill that I will carry forward into all further jobs, to get accustomed with the company’s development infrastructure and simply learn more about the skills I have already developed. </p>
                    <h4>Documentation Skills</h4>
                    <p>However outside of my learning goals I learned some things that I did not expect. The first of these was the ability to document my work and how to do so in a way slightly different to how I did it at school. In classes when writing code, documentation  looked like comments in my code and a readme to explain to TAs how to run my code but in both of these situations I could assume that the person reading it would have a certain amount of technical knowledge and thus the documentation only needed to cover the specific things that I had thought of. I could lean on the fact that the TA already knows how to write C or how to use the technologies that I am using, documentation only needed to cover the specifics of my project. However, at Agnico this was not an assumption I could lean on as many of the people I was working with, specifically the users and maintainers of my page have very little technical knowledge and are not familiar at all with how technologies like SharePoint and PowerApps work. In this situation I had to make a very different kind of documentation that felt more like a user’s manual than what I was used to writing for classes. Despite the practice I have received doing this already, this is not a skill I think I have fully developed as I feel I still sometimes lose my boss when explaining things to her so this is something I will be working on further in the fall. </p>
                    <h4>Design With Updates In Mind</h4>
                    <p>The other thing that I learned outside of my learning goals was how to design solutions and complete tasks with updates in mind. At school I would write the code for a project, hand it in, and then it would be complete with no need to revisit or refactor any of it later. However, at Agnico (and nearly every practical application/job) this is very rarely the case. Requirements for my work changed constantly as things outside of my control are frequently updated and improved. This meant that I needed to learn how to develop solutions that would be flexible and easily changed in the future. At the beginning of the work term this was an issue as I would end up creating things and then the next week, I would be forced to do a ton more work to accommodate changes. An example of this would be when I created a series of PowerApps to display some information relating to the company’s financial accounts, but after I did this, the way that this data needed to be displayed changed and instead of simply being able to change the fields being shown I had to redo a lot of work to accommodate this new change.  This rigidity led to me repeating a lot of my work. However, across the work term I learned how to create better solutions so that when it came to making a way to display information related to the company’s many acronyms, I was able to create a solution that was adaptable, and I can change in mere minutes as requirements change. This is an extremely valuable skill that will be in constant use in all further roles, and I am very glad I had this experience to learn it. </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>This work term I have made very meaningful progress on all the goals I laid out at the beginning of the term through the completion of my intranet page project. But I also learned more than I predicted by gaining experience documenting my work as well important design principles like creating products with updates in mind.  I found my summer term at Agnico to be invaluable to my development and as I take on a new project (on top of the maintenance of my intranet page now that it's in production), I cannot wait to learn more! </p>
