                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the Fall semester of 2023 I worked as a Data Analyst at Agnico Eagle Mines. This was my second co-op term with the company and in this term my role transitioned from the creation of an internal website for my team to rebuilding a costing dashboard for all the company’s mine sites. Though doing this I was able to refine my PowerBI skills and I learn how to clean and prepare data sets for visualization. Additionally, I was able to improve my documentation skills, something I mentioned in my summer report as a skill I needed to improve. </p>

                    <p>Agnico Eagle is Canadian gold mining company founded in 1957 that has several precious metal mines around the world in countries such as Canada, Australia, Finland, Mexico and development projects in the United States and Columbia. In addition to gold, the company also produces a large amount of silver, zinc, and copper as by-products of the mining process.  </p>

                <div id="jobDescription">
                    <h2>Job Description</h2>
                    <p>During this term my responsibilities were quite bit more varied than in the summer term. The main project that I was working on was rebuilding one of the company’s costing dashboards. This was mainly completed using PowerBI and SQL although Azure Databricks was also used. On top of this I was also assigned to a secondary supervisor who had me creating and updating dashboards outside of the costing one. The internal website I created in the summer was also still my responsibility to maintain and update as it went live to the company. As the website was already complete, I had already become quite capable with the required technologies like Power Automate, PowerApps and SharePoint but in the maintenance of a live website I learned other skills like how to document my work so it can be maintained by someone else in my absence.  </p>
                </div>
                <div id="goals">
                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>For this second work term I set 3 goals for myself, those being, to learn how to clean and prepare data for visualization, to improve the scope of my abilities in PowerBI and to improve my ability to document my work (something I highlighted in my last work term report as something I could improve on). I feel that I achieved all these goals quite thoroughly however almost none of them were achieved in the manner I set out at the beginning of the term in my learning goals.</p>
                    <h4>Preparing and Cleaning Data Sets for Visualization</h4>
                    <p>The first goal was to the learn how to prepare data sets for visualization. This had interested me in my previous work term because back then I was always working with data that was prepared on my behalf and in this term when I would be working with far more data, I wanted to be more self sufficient by learning how to clean the data myself. In my learning goals I set out that I expected to learn this while rebuilding the costing dashboard, but I quickly learned that the current state of that data was far too complicated for me to understand and learn that way, instead this was a skill that I learned by helping out Julio with updates to other dashboards. He gave me the opportunity to work on some simpler data and work my way up to the daunting task that was the costing dashboard. With Julio I was able to start slow by changing the way data was already set up before setting it up from scratch myself, he was also a very capable mentor and taught me the way he goes about organizing and cleaning data by including me and giving me a lot of the work on a new dashboard being created for one of the Nunavut sites. This simpler project and Julio’s guidance were extremely helpful in giving me the skills to end up rebuilding the costing dashboard on my own. The fact that I was able to build this skill up to the point where I was able create my own cleaner and easier version of the data for the costing dashboard from dozens of different sites goes to show the amount of progress I made in this area, and I am very proud of how far I came with this skill. This will be very helpful in all data related roles I will do in the future as I now have a far deeper understanding of how data can be manipulated to be useful. </p>
                    <h4>Power BI</h4>
                    <p>The second goal I worked on this semester was my ability to use PowerBI. This was something I wanted to achieve as data visualization is a very important part of all businesses and will be a very valuable skill for my career. I figured that I would also learn this skill during the rebuilding of the costing dashboard but again it came from my experience working with Julio. Julio gave me many tasks to ingest data into PowerBI in different ways, to build visuals and to create new ones. Throughout this experience I became very proficient in PowerBI so that by the time I got to creating the costing dashboard my boss was quite impressed by both the quality the dashboard and the pace at which I was able to the build out the functionality she wanted. Across my 4 months working heavily with PowerBI I felt myself becoming quite capable with the software and using it became quite easy and intuitive for me, it really felt like I had gotten good at a skill. That is a feeling I would like to chase for the rest of my career as I felt a very genuine fulfillment from it. </p>
                    <h4>Documentation</h4>
                    <p>The final learning goal that I worked on this semester was the was documentation. In the summer I felt that I lacked in this field and was hoping to improve on it this term with the documentation of my costing dashboard project. Throughout work on the dashboard, I took many notes on all the changes and the current state of everything so that my colleagues would be able to use it in the future. This was something that I saw come to fruition sooner than I expected as one of my colleagues already used this documentation to make changes to the dashboard in my last week with Agnico so I would consider this a success. However, I ended up getting some more documentation experience than I originally expected as I ended up having to teach a new employee about how to maintain all of my work for the internal website that I made. This allowed to expand my documentation skill set beyond just describing what I had done so that others could understand my work and into the creating of resources so that my colleagues could understand my workflow, how I expected changes is the future would likely need to be done and how to trouble shoot common problems I faced. I also got to document my work in the form of presentations to colleagues and expand my repertoire beyond the written word. This aspect will be very useful in the future as I will now be capable of creating more user centered resources like the FAQs and home pages you would see in GitHub repos and fully released applications. In this way I feel that I received a great deal of experience with the skill and was able to expand my capabilities to what I had hoped in the summer. </p>

                <div id="conclusion">
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>In conclusion, this term I learned many data related skills like how to clean and prepare data set as well as data visualization techniques that I hope to be able to apply to a more coding/software related position in the future. In addition to these technical skills, I was able to expand on some more general employee related skills like documentation of my work and how to train others, that felt I lacked at the end of my summer term. I believe that this term with Agnico has been an extremely valuable experience that will help make me into a well-rounded employee in the future. I would also like to thank Julia for being an amazing boss who always wanted me to succeed, Julio for teaching me an absolute boatload, and Kris and Cassandra for making my time in the office a bunch of fun.</p>
